//OPERTAORS

//Compound assignment operators in java
//+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=, >>>=

//a=a+4;
//a+=4;
//the above is same and an example of compound assignment operator

//arithmetics operators
// +, -, *, /, %, ++, --    

//num-=1;
//num=num-1;

//num*=1;
//num=num*1;

//num/=1;
//num=num/1;

//num%=1;
//num=num%1;

//num1++ is equivalent to num1=num1+1 or num1+=1.All these are same
//num1-- is equivalent to num1=num1-1 or num1-=1.All these are same

//POST AND PRE INCREMENT AND DECREMENT
//int a=1;
//int b=++a; //pre increment
//int c=a++; //post increment
//int d=--a; //pre decrement
//int e=a--; //post decrement
// in pre increment and decrement the value is first incremented or decremented and then assigned to the variable.That is 
//in pre increment and decrement the value is first changed and then assigned to the variable

//RELATIONAL OPERATORS
// ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

//LOGICAL OPERATORS
// &&, ||, !
//these are used to combine two or more conditions.That is to compare two or more relational operators
